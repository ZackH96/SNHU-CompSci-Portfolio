This project is Project 3: Corner Grocer, which is a C++ program designed and written as an inventory tracker for a given gorcery store. 
The problem this program solves is the tracking of inventory from text records related to purchases of said inventory.
I think I wrote the program logic and output quite well, including the header file, because Version 4, after the complete disasters of Versions 1 through 3, actually output everything as requested. 
I also think I did well on the input validation, which was a real pain to get working, and when that Version 4 test with inputs like "Shoe" and "Person" printed the "item not found" message, I was relieved.
I could've enhanced the code with additional protections, perhaps a python script to get the input validation to cooperate, but beyond that, my only downfall was my lousy documentation.
Like I said, the input validation was the worst part. In Version 3, it would print the same number and the input string every time. Instead of "item not found", it was "Shoe found 41 times" or something.
After a lot of troubleshooting and tinkering, I overcame the issue with a deep dive on Google as to why this was happening, meaning Google is my new best friend and I will be making extensive use of it.
Honestly, being able to understand C++, never mind writing it, will be my most transferrable skill. The way I see it, if one can grasp C++, Java and Python should be a cake walk.
If I'm being honest, and my god-awful documentation submission proves this, the amount of tinkering and troubleshooting has made this project a bit on the wonky side when it comes to maintenance and adaptability.
It's 100% readable, but I dare not try and maintain or adapt the project lest it fall apart. Again. For the umpteenth time. Sometimes, letting well enough alone is the best course of action, especially when something is actually functioning as intended.
That being said, in a workplace environment, I understand that I would likely be required to maintain and adapt code, and if I'm working with actual professionals, it wouldn't be wonky code written by a college student.
