1. I would interpret user needs by conducting user research, analyzing and defining personas, translating needs into requirements, prioritize features as needed, develop and iterate the actual code, and do rigorous testing and validation. Creating user stories helps with this by promoting user-centricity, fostering collaboration and communication, encouraging creative solutions, facilitating prioritization and planning, and enabling testable criteria.
2. I would break down my approach to developing programs by getting an understanding of the problem, gathering the requirements needed, planning a novel solution, implementing solutions incrementally, continuously testing, relfecting, refining, writing easy-to-understand documentation, and maintaining the code with regular updates. The Agile processes I would incorporate are iterative and incremental development, user stories, Daily Scrum, continuous feedback, customer collaboration, sprint reviews and retrospectives, test-driven development, and the extensive use of collaboration tools.
3. To be a good team member in software development is to be reliable, communicative, collaborative, problem-solving, and adaptable.
